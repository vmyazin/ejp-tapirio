      <description><![CDATA[<p>My guest today is Leo Lugansky, a musician involved in multiple projects, such as an alternative metal band Foirmoda and a Depeche Mode tribute band Strangelove. I sat down with Leo in Brooklyn to chat about music, making it in the international rock music scene and an assortment of other topics.</p>
        <p>Growing up in Volgograd, Russia he spent a lot of time tinkering with synthesizers and got involved in local musical circuits. Eventually, Leo moved to the USA and took his career to the next level blending various genres of rock and electronic music. By the way he looks and moves you can tell he made his passion for stage performance a permanent lifestyle. That even led him to working as a part-time model and actor but this is not where his main fervor lies.</p>
        <p>Tune in to this episode to find out how Leo walked his path from an audiophile to a musician touring the world.</p>]]></description>

    Vasily gets on a call with Cristine in Los Angeles to talk about her life growing up in the Philippines with Taiwanese parents, studying in France and USA, being a 3rd culture kid and navigation global mental health issues.</p>
    <p>We covered a lot of ground in this fun interview. Apart from taking a dive into Cristine&#8217;s upbringing between different cultures, we also discussed influence of social networks on the lives of adults and children and what we can do about the adverse effects of being online to excess. Be on the lookout for her upcoming book about third culture kids.</p>

  <p>I met Brett Whiteside at a meet up in Chiang Mei, Thailand. He is a well-known teacher of Thai and several other languages. Brett moved out of USA 15 years ago and almost never looked back. We talked about expat life, learning completely foreign languages and many other cool nerdy things.</p>
  <p>Brett shared how learning languages opens new doors and makes life (abroad) a lot more enjoyable. We went over some cultural quirks of Thailand and how to adjust to new life circumstances. If you are looking for an additional kick in the butt to start traveling, you are going to love this episode.</p>

    <p>While staying in Mexico for a few weeks I got the chance to interview Sergio Sala, a prominent champion of the Digital Nomad movement, or simply, as we agreed, a world traveler who works and enjoys life around the globe. We talked about what it means to be constantly on the go and the importance of slowing down. We covered Sergio&#8217;s journey from a freshly graduated architect working at a firm he co-founded to a well-known advocate of working and traveling with just a backpack and a laptop. We discussed the freelancing, finding your niche, converting your skills into something you can offer while being in remote locations.</p>
    <p>Sergio&#8217;s online presence is mainly focused on the Spanish-speaking world, so consider this his foray into the international scene. He has created an online course on becoming a digital nomad, in Spanish. The many topics and people we talked about are included in the links section below. This is was a short but jam-packed episode, so put press play and enjoy!</p>

    <description><![CDATA[Today’s guest is Chase Yang, a California native, entrepreneur, ex-Googler, world traveler, and video blogger. He runs a business online that allows him to be location-independent. He brings with him an ungodly amount of gear and uses every bit of it to create photo and video content.

  We met at Punspace, the semi-famous coworking space in Chiang Mai, Thailand. Chase was working diligently on his video blog and editing photos while sweating excruciating details. I saw that he cared about quality and was willing to pay the price. During this interview we talked about Chase cutting the chains of in-office employment, burning the boats to start his online online business and leaving his relaxing home turf of LA behind to explore South East Asia, Australia and New Zealand. He is a trained actor and we talked about how acting can help you in life. We touched on Chase’s near-death experience after a horrific motorcycle accident. He also gives some indispensable tips on how to be productive while traveling. Enjoy!]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[My guest today is a Missouri native, an athlete training to be a ninja, previously a senior developer at a tech startup and a DJ. A few of years ago he left San Francisco to travel around the globe and perform rigorous physical training. He then settled down in Southeast Asia for a while enjoying a new life by the beach. Let’s find out how it all happened. Without further ado I give you – Matt Barnicle aka Nomadic Ninja.

  Having been friends for over 11 years, naturally, it was an easy conversation and a good chance to catch up in Bangkok. We covered an array of topics from quite deep to decidedly light-hearted. Matt has had a fascinating trajectory that can serve as inspiration to many struggling with finding their path and improving their mental and physical states. I hope you enjoy this interview as much as I did.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[My guest today is a Bay Area native with Indian roots, a comedian and a writer. His father once told him to be a doctor so he wouldn't have to face the hardship of being a computer engineer. Despite that, he held a job as a programmer in Silicon Valley until he finally quit it after 10 years to pursue comedy full time. Dear audience, I give you Richard Sarvate!

  We chatted about Richard's childhood in the suburban Bay Area, being secluded, passion for comedy, golden handcuffs, quitting, persisting, bombing, and goal-setting. It's been a very fun and enlightening conversation and I hope y'all enjoy it.]]></description>
